## YE2024 Campaign
**Role**: Chief AI Strategist
**Dates**: Nov 2022 - Present

- **Donda-OS**: Architected a proprietary LLM fine-tuned on the entire discography of Kanye West. The model generates policy proposals that are 85% more emotionally engaging than standard political rhetoric.
- **Viral Agent Swarm**: Deployed a fleet of autonomous Twitter agents that analyze cultural zeitgeist in real-time and inject "truth bombs" to shift the narrative window.
- **Aesthetic Governance**: Collaborated with visual artists to ensure all campaign materials (digital and physical) adhere to a strict "brutalist-futurist" design language generated by custom Stable Diffusion models.

- **YZY-SHLD**: Developed a bot-mitigation system that uses behavioral biometrics (mouse movement entropy) to distinguish true fans from scalper bots during limited drops. Reduced bot success rate by 99.9%.

## Gap Inc.
**Role**: Strategic Visionary (Contract)
**Dates**: Jan 2018 - May 2019
