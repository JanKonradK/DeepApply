# The Manifesto: "Future-Proofing Humanity"

## Projects
- **Project OMEGA**: An attempt to train an AI on the collective unconscious of the internet to predict the next big meme before it happens.
- **Sunday Service VR**: A fully immersive virtual reality experience that simulates the acoustics of a James Turrell crater.

## Core Beliefs
1. **Decentralization is Freedom**: We must own our data, our identity, and our digital footprint.
2. **Aesthetics are Moral**: Ugly interfaces lead to ugly thoughts. Beautiful design elevates the human condition.
3. **AI as a Tool for Amplification**: AI should not replace human creativity; it should be a megaphone for it.

## Hobbies
- **Modular Synthesis**: Building patches that sound like the heat death of the universe.
- **Brutalist Architecture Photography**: Documenting concrete structures in post-Soviet states.
- **Fashion Archiving**: Collecting vintage Raf Simons pieces.
