## About Me
I am a visionary technologist operating at the intersection of artificial intelligence, political strategy, and avant-garde aesthetics. My work is not just about code; it's about rewriting the source code of culture itself. I believe in the power of "radical transparency" and "algorithmic truth."

Currently serving as the Chief AI Strategist for the YE2024 campaign, I leverage large language models to deconstruct political discourse and reconstruct it into a more honest, raw, and emotionally resonant form. I don't just build agents; I build digital extensions of the human spirit.

## Philosophy
"If you can't code it in Rust, does it even exist?"
"The future is not written, it is generated."
